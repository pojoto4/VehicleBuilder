 This app uses Inquirer prompts so you can make sure it's in your dependencies and then input npm run start into your terminal.

## Usage

 You can choose what type of vehicle you want to build and then input its details and perform actions like tow and wheelie. The truck will be able to tow any cars or motorbikes but only the motorbike will be able to do a wheelie.
